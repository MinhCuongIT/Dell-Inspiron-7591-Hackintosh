## About build

- <strong> You need at least Macos 10.15.5 to boot with SMBIOS 16,1 </strong>
- Intel wifi card is finally worked:
  - Follow this: https://openintelwireless.github.io

#### Performance

- [Geekbench 5](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/1927376): 1052 SingleCore, 3935 MultiCore
- Battery: 57wh with 87% health and 60% brightness (2 NVME and 1 SSD SATA), I got 3h20 screen time when suffering web and light code

#### Not Working

- Thing may never work:
  - Discrete GPU (Disabled)
  - Fingerprint (Disabled)
  - Internal Microphone

#### HDMI blinking at boot

> This will happen when using plug-in HDMI after bootup. This will be fixed after short sleep (about 1min) and never happen again until reboot

- You can fixed this by turn off **com.apple.driver.AppleHDAController** in `Kernel and Kext Patches` on Clover or `Kernel > Patch` on Opencore but **HDMI Audio** will be disabled

> From 10.15.6, event 11, HDMI audio is `dead`, still finding solution

## For building

> This will pull all newest kext and build into zip files

- Clone this repo
- Run follow command: `python3 update.py --build`
- Get your build at Builds folder

## Installation

### BIOS

- Disk in `AHCI` mode
- Fastboot: `Thorough`
- Power on lid: `Disabled` - Fix black screen after wake
- Disabled thunderbolt `auto switch` and select it to `BIOS assist` for better battery management in Catalina and BigSur

### STEP

> You can follow [Dortania's guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) as it very detail and easy to understand.

#### Short once

- Prepair an Mac installer in USB with bootloader you choice ( Use unibeast to create it )
- Go to `release` and download lastest version of your choice ( Clover or Opencore )
- Replace EFI folder in USB EFI partition with this shipped EFI folder ( find the folder with name is `EFI` from zip file)
- Boot into USB and select MacOs installer
- After install success, run PostInstall/install.sh in terminal
- Then you need to mount EFI partition and replace it with USB's EFI
- After System EFI replaced by your EFI, Using Opencore Configurator, Clover Configurator or update script to change SMBIOS, generate your serial and MBL
- If you're using intel card, please use NullEthernet for fixing iMess and FaceTime - Change MAC in NullEthernet with your new created one, see below
- For intel wifi card's user, follow [Intel's guide](https://openintelwireless.github.io) for init your wifi

#### Fake ethernet

- Generate your MAC address in SSDT-RMNE if using NullEthernet
- You can make an MacAddress in [Mac generator online](https://www.browserling.com/tools/random-mac)
- Edit SSDT-RMNE.aml with MaciASL and replace MAC with your generated one
- Save as -> ACPI machine language (replace exited one)
- Add it to your bootloader:
  - Kext add in Kexts:
    - Copy kext to kexts/other if using Clover
    - Copy kext to Kexts and add it into Kernel in config.plist (Use OpencoreConfigurator)
  - AML's file add to ACPI folder (Opencore need add to ACPI after copy SSDT file to ACPI, use OpencoreConfigurator)
- Reboot

#### Sleep Wake

```shell
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0 (optional)
```

> `-b` - Battery `-c` - AC Power `-a` - Both

Please uncheck all options (except `Prevent computer from sleeping...`, which is optional) in the `Energy Saver` panel.

#### Display

If you are using FHD(1080p) display, you may want to enable font smoothing, run this command from terminal:

```
defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO
```

If your laptop display is 4K screen, you should set uiscale to 2:

- Opencore: NVRAM -> Add -> 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 -> UIScale -> 2
- Clover: BootGraphics -> UIScale -> 2

#### Using DW1820a as wifi card

- <del> You have to do following changes to Device Properties or it `cant boot into macos`:
- DW1820a now have been supported by `AirportBrcmFixup`, if u facing with connection issues then follow bellow

> Change

```xml
<key>#PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1c,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)</key>
```

> Into

```xml
<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1c,0x0)/Pci(0x0,0x0)</key>
```

- See [THE Solution:Dell DW1820A](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/the-solution-dell-dw1820a-broadcom-bcm94350zae-macos-15.288026/)
- Other card you may need google for it

#### NTFS Writing

Add `UUID=xxx none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse` to `/etc/fstab`, **xxx** is the UUID of your NTFS partition.

If your NTFS partition has Windows installed, you need to run `powercfg -h off` in powershell in Windows to disable hibernation.

#### Tap Delay

- Turn off `Smart zoom` to avoid two-finger tap delay.

## BIOS value unlock (Advanced User)

> Big thanks for @Leoing, who found all nessesary value

| Name         | Address | Configable value | Default value |
| :----------- | :------ | :--------------- | :------------ |
| CFC-Lock     | 0x6F0   | 0x1 or 0x0       | 0x1           |
| DGPU         | 0x574   | 0x1 or 0x0       | 0x1           |
| Voltage Lock | 0x78C   | 0x1 or 0x0       | 0x1 (1.6.0)   |

You can follow [this](https://github.com/Azkali/GPD-P2-MAX-Hackintosh/issues/16#issuecomment-565882180) to change those value

> For Bios 1.6.0 `0x78C` need set to 0x0 so VoltageShift can be used

> You can use mine SmartCPU Script base on VoltageShift for controlling cpu power's usage: [SmartCPU](https://github.com/tctien342/smart-cpu)
